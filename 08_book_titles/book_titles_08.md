# Book Titles #08

Reading the spec file it looksl ike they want a class called `book` that has a method called `title` that will  automaticaly capitazlie titles unless a specific '_article_' is specitifed that will be skipped.

e.g. "Alexander the Great" would have 'the' passed as an argument to not be capitalized

### Create the class
